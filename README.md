# Prompt Engineering to Generate Website on v0

By Weng Fei Fung (Weng). This project highlights how I engineered and optimized a prompt using text generation tools—combining a ChatGPT-4 style guide with business needs—to get high-quality results from v0’s text-to-website generator (https://v0.dev/). The site was then deployed to Heroku, Netlify, and Vercel.

## Live Demos

You can check out the live demos at:
- [Netlify Demo](https://effortless-creponne-47734f.netlify.app/)
- [Vercel Demo](https://ai-generated-website.vercel.app/)
- Heroku Demo ~~(wf-electric-becd0dc31639.herokuapp{DOT}com/)~~
   - I took it offline because it was costing $5/month doing nothing. Heroku has no free tier.

## Development Process

1. Initial style guide and branding was generated using ChatGPT 4
2. The style guide and business requirements were then fed into v0's text to website generator
3. The resulting code was deployed to Heroku, Netlify, and Vercel for testing
